Description: Cat Name Based Secure Password Generator
 MeowPassword generates secure, memorable passwords using a database
 of over 16,000 cat names. The generated passwords include:
 .
  - Base phrases from randomly selected cat names
  - Random capitalization of letters
  - Insertion of random numbers
  - Replacement of letters with symbols
 .
 Password quality is measured using Shannon entropy, compression
 resistance, pattern complexity, and character diversity metrics
 to ensure generated passwords meet security requirements.
